#gulp-include [![NPM version][npm-image]][npm-url] ![Travis build][travis-image]
>Makes inclusion of files a breeze.  
Enables functionality similar to that of snockets / sprockets or other file insertion compilation tools.

> Made for gulp 3

By [wiledal](https://github.com/wiledal) with help from [juanghurtado](https://github.com/juanghurtado)


## Usage
First, install `gulp-include` as a dev dependency:
`npm install --save-dev gulp-include`

Then, add your _include-comments_ to your file.  
_People who have experience with `sprockets` or `snockets` will feel at home._ 


An _include-comment_ looks like this:
```javascript
//= include relative/path/to/file.js
```
or 
```coffeescript
#= require_tree relative/path/to/folder
```
or even
```javascript
/*
= include relative/path/to/file.js
= require relative/path/to/file2.js
= include_tree relative/path/to/folder
*/
```
`gulp-include` does not care about whitespace, as long as the comment-line starts with a  _newline_ followed `=` and contains `include`, `require` or `include_tree`, `require_tree`.


The example below compiles a several coffee-files and js-files into a single js-file:

`app.coffee`:

```coffeescript
`
//= require vendor/jquery.js
//= require vendor/modernizr.js
`

#= require controllers/AppController.coffee
#= require_tree views

class Main extends AppController
	constructor: ->
		console.log "This is main!"

window.main = new Main()
```
*Note:* The example above uses backsticks (\`) to allow `gulp-coffee` to compile inline javascript

`gulpfile.js`:

```javascript
var gulp		= require('gulp'),
	include		= require('gulp-include'),
	coffee		= require('gulp-coffee');

gulp.task("scripts", function() {
	gulp.src('src/js/app.coffee')
		.pipe( include() )
		.pipe( coffee() )
		.pipe( gulp.dest("dist/js") )
});

gulp.task("default", "scripts");
```

## Options
* `extensions` (optional)
	* Takes a `String` or an `Array` of extensions, eg: `"js"` or `["js", "coffee"]`
	* If set, all inclusions that does not match the extension(s) will be ignored

## Release log
#### 0.2.1
* Changed replace-method to fix issue when requiring a file that contained special characters ([juanghurtado](https://github.com/juanghurtado))

#### 0.2.0
* Added `require_tree`/`include_tree` (Thanks to [juanghurtado](https://github.com/juanghurtado)!)
* Method now takes an `extensions` param for controlling what types of files to include

#### 0.1.0
* Basic include
